        <h3>Before I begin a few points:</h3>
        <p>Something</p>

        <h4 class="highlight-point">About the GitHub API:</h4>
        <p>Originally when I first started planning out the presentation and goals for this project I assumed the API would provide historical data. If you'd like I could get the data needed from the GitHub Archive(but that would take more than a few hours)</p>
        <p>Missing Features I wanted to add, but did not have the data to support:</p>
        <strong>Trend analysis of each Repos historical data, such as:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Stars, Watchers, Downloads growth over time</li>
            <li>Graphs to compare over all growth rate</li>
            <li>Graphs to visualize the velocity of change of each repo over time</li>
            <li>Metric Ratios such as Stars to age(this I actually do have the data for) </li>
            <li>Open issues over time, and rate of change</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Other cool but out of scope ideas:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Analyze active public repos using each framework and it's changes over time, and possibly adding a regression line to crudely predict the "future" </li>
            <li>Web crawl certain sites and run comments a sentiment analysis on each framework.(I am currently working on a project that is loosely similar) </li>
        </ol>
